<h3>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</h3>
<h4>
  Description: SECOND ACT-Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house.

  </h4>
<p>
<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p>Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all that?</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <P>Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p><br>
    
<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>  <p>What a pity!  I beg
your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that.  But if what you
tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
Lady Chiltern.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p>It would be quite useless.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p>May I try?</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p>Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p>Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
experiment.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p>All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p>Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  If it wasn’t so,
life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
you should have told her years ago.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p>When?  When we were engaged?  Do you think she
would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_Slowly_.]</p>  <p>Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There
is no doubt of that.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_Bitterly_.]</p>  <p>Men who every day do something of
the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
in their own lives.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p>That is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
people’s secrets.  It distracts public attention from their own.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p>And, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
one.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>  <p>Except yourself, Robert.</p><br>

<h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_After a pause_.]</p>  <p>Of course I had private
information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
source of every large modern fortune.</p><br>

<h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "stagedirection">[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]</p>  <p>And public scandal
invariably the result.</p><br>
