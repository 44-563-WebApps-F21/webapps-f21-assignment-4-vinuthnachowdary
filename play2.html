        <h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4> <p class= "stagedirection">[_Pacing up and down the room_.]</p>  <p class= "speech">Arthur, do you think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?</p><br>
        <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4> <p class= "speech">Life is never fair, Robert.  And perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is not.</p><br>
        
        <h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p class= "speech">Every man of ambition has to fight his century with its own weapons.  What this century worships is wealth.  The God of this century is wealth.  To succeed one must have wealth.  At all costs one must have wealth.</p><br>
        
        <h4 class= "LORDGORING">LORD GORING.</h4>  <p class= "p.speech">You underrate yourself, Robert.  Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded just as well.</p><br>
        
        <h4 class= "SIRROBERTCHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  <p class= "speech">When I was old, perhaps.  When I had lost my passion for power, or could not use it.  When I was tired, worn out, disappointed.  I wanted my success when I was young.  Youth is the time for success.  I couldn’t wait.</p><br>
